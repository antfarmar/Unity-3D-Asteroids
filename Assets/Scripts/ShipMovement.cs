/// DEBUG ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Debug.Log()         // Logs message to the Unity Console.
Debug.Assert()	    // Assert the condition.
Debug.DrawLine()    // Draws a line between specified start and end points.

/// GIZMOS.XXX
Implement OnDrawGizmos if you want to draw gizmos that are also pickable and always drawn.
This allows you to quickly pick important objects in your scene.
Note that OnDrawGizmos will use a mouse position that is relative to the Scene View.
This function does not get called if the component is collapsed in the inspector. Use OnDrawGizmosSelected to draw gizmos when the game object is selected.

OnDrawGizmos() { }
OnDrawGizmosSelected() { }

GIZMO STATIC FUNCTIONS
DrawCube	Draw a solid box with center and size.
DrawFrustum	Draw a camera frustum using the currently set Gizmos.matrix for it's location and rotation.
DrawGUITexture	Draw a texture in the scene.
DrawIcon	Draw an icon at a position in the scene view.
DrawLine	Draws a line starting at from towards to.
DrawMesh	Draws a mesh.
DrawRay	Draws a ray starting at from to from + direction.
DrawSphere	Draws a solid sphere with center and radius.
DrawWireCube	Draw a wireframe box with center and size.
DrawWireMesh	Draws a wireframe mesh.
DrawWireSphere	Draws a wireframe sphere with center and radius.


/// INPUT ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/// MOUSE
Called every frame while the mouse is over the GUIElement or Collider.
These functions are not called on objects that belong to Ignore Raycast layer.
These functions are called on Colliders marked as Trigger if and only if Physics.queriesHitTriggers is true.
OnMouseXXX can be a co-routine, simply use the yield statement in the function. This event is sent to all scripts attached to the Collider or GUIElement.

void OnMouseEnter() { }         // called when the mouse enters the GUIElement or Collider.
void OnMouseOver() { }          // called every frame while the mouse is over the GUIElement or Collider.
void OnMouseDrag() { }          // called when the user has clicked on a GUIElement or Collider and is still holding down the mouse.
void OnMouseExit() { }          // called when the mouse is not any longer over the GUIElement or Collider.
void OnMouseDown() { }          // called when the user has pressed the mouse button while over the GUIElement or Collider.
void OnMouseUp() { }            // called when the user has released the mouse button
void OnMouseUpAsButton() { }    // called when the mouse is released over the SAME GUIElement or Collider as it was pressed.
   
   
/// PHYSICS     ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 OnCollisionEnter is passed the Collision class and not a Collider.
 The Collision class contains information about contact points, impact velocity etc.
 If you don't use collisionInfo in the function, leave out the collisionInfo parameter as this avoids unnecessary calculations.
 Collision events are only sent if one of the colliders also has a non-kinematic rigidbody attached.
 Collision events will be sent to disabled MonoBehaviours, to allow enabling Behaviours in response to collisions.
 
void OnTriggerXXX() { }         // Enter|Exit|Stay
void OnCollisionXXX() { }


/// COROUTINES ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Normal coroutine updates are run after the Update function returns. A coroutine is a function that can suspend its execution (yield) until the given YieldInstruction finishes. Different uses of Coroutines:

yield                       The coroutine will continue after all Update functions have been called on the next frame.
yield WaitForSeconds        Continue after a specified time delay, after all Update functions have been called for the frame
yield WaitForFixedUpdate    Continue after all FixedUpdate has been called on all scripts
yield WaitForEndOfFrame     Continue after all FixedUpdate has been called on all scripts
yield WWW                   Continue after a WWW download has completed.
yield StartCoroutine        Chains the coroutine, and will wait for the MyFunc coroutine to complete first.


/// RENDERING ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

OnPreCull: Called before the camera culls the scene. Culling determines which objects are visible to the camera. OnPreCull is called just before culling takes place.
OnBecameVisible/OnBecameInvisible: Called when an object becomes visible/invisible to any camera.
OnWillRenderObject: Called once for each camera if the object is visible.
OnPreRender: Called before the camera starts rendering the scene.
OnRenderObject: Called after all regular scene rendering is done. You can use GL class or Graphics.DrawMeshNow to draw custom geometry at this point.
OnPostRender: Called after a camera finishes rendering the scene.
OnRenderImage: Called after scene rendering is complete to allow postprocessing of the screen image.
OnGUI: Called multiple times per frame in response to GUI events. The Layout and Repaint events are processed first, followed by a Layout and keyboard/mouse event for each input event.
OnDrawGizmos: Used for drawing Gizmos in the scene view for visualisation purposes.
